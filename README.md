# Neovim

My Neovim configuration, tailored to my personal needs and liking.

## Features

Some of the core features of my config include:

* Language Server Protocol support.
* Code autocompletion.
* Fuzzy finder.
* Tree-sitter support.

## Philosophy

I like to keep my config simple and relatively minimal, at least for what I
consider minimal. There are not a lot of UI modifications to Neovim's defaults,
so, for example, you won't find any statusline plugin or other plugins that
override or extend the UI capabilities of Neovim such as prettifying the popups
or replacing the quickfix list or command line.

Keep in mind that I'm constantly updating this configuration to fit it to my
needs. My goal is to have a clean configuration that you can take as inspiration
to create yours, but I do not plan to maintain a stable config repo. Still, you
can submit issues if you run into them, or even send suggestions.

## Requirements

* Latest stable version of Neovim.
* fzf binaries installed.
* Git installed.
* A C compiler like gcc or clang.
